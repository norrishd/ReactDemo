# React-Demo
A silly React Node.js app with create-react-app, just to practise my skills.

What will it contain? Only time can tell. To get started, from the root 
director enter:

```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

## Development
Starter code was generated with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html#creating-a-new-application)  

Create-React-App doesn't handle backend logic, just sets up development env, 
creates a frontend build pipeline and optimises app for production.

Command for a new project:

```javascript
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app
```

Deploy to production with:
```javascript
npm run build
```
